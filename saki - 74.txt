do you have a moment?

 

yes, I do.

*temporary coach, etc. Please adjust or whatever

 

Nooo~~ please stop that "sub" thing~

 

I'm doing my best as coach here, you know~

 

*himematsu high's mahjong club sub-coach

Akasaka Ikuno

 

you're being a bit cocky, given that Coach Kanno is being hospitalized.

Please stop that

 

 

05

Sorry~ also, actually....

 

.........

 

I want to make you join the regular team for the team match

 

I refuse

 

Ha?*

 

*or "Eh"

 

haaa~?*

 

*or "Eeeeh...!?" (IATC: I recommend ''Eh?'' for both)

 

Who's on the team?

 

*derp fix

 

3rd year's Nakagishi-san, MIno-san, and Umegaki-san

 

Amongst the 2nd years, it would be you and the older Atago-san. how about it~?

 

*TL : older atago = hiroe, as you see from previous page, you can see Hiroe and Kinue have same family name, so they're real siblings. nice XD

 

Why don't you take Ueshige instead of me?

 

Ueshige.....

That freshman girl who people bully...?

 

*er, "the freshman who is usually bullied" or something

 

Isn't she too weak?

 

That's because she's playing with our house rules*

 

*The rules usually used internally. I hope that's the correct term. Or else please fix

 

 

06

alt: but if it's just a simple match counting final points alone without additional modifiers, she's always got positive points.

 

////FIXME FIXME But if the match is a simple one that only counts income points and doesn't count OKA and point order (Juniten), she's always got surplus points.
*TL : OKA(ã‚ªã‚«) and juniten(é †ä½ç‚¹), the keywords to understands suzu's skill, since i don't understand what are they talking about, do something edho ;p
IATC: This should work.

 

she even ranked first last month

 

that's weird. Isn't she always in last place~?

 

*er, lowest rank, fix

 

She won a game by rare chance, but she won explosively

 

she even gained 6000 points the stronger the opponent became

 

explosive, huh?

 

Alright, how about you check her out at the next ABmatch?

*TL : ABmatch, training match
*or just use training match
(IATC: I think I'll keep AB Match - It's a nice treat for Mahjong-proficient readers)

 

Alright, as long as the opponent isn't our captain

 
oh... but don't tell anyone that I mentioned Ueshige
(IATC: The sensors on my Yuridar have perked up!)

 

He~~~? why~~?

*TL : omg ikuno's so cute, but noisy

 

 

07

because it's embarrassing...

 

....

 

The vanguard match remains in the third round of the south hand of the first half___ It is now Himematsu's turn as dealer...

 

where's the explo~sio~~n~~?

 

yesterday was a misfire.

.....

 

Her presence vanished like mist in the first half...

but... what's this...?

 

*sigh....

 

The maiden has suddenly become eerie again...

 

it's a pinch...

 

 

15
*oh~~
(IATC: My body was completely not ready for that. TY Toyone for making my nutbladder hurt.)

 

Even though it's a bit late, she's scary...

you're right. The maiden turned into a demon

*TL: good god, there's no next issue for next 2 weeks, omg next issue on 2nd december... so it's a..safe? please mention my apology on the credit & weblog. I apologizing for the late of translation, because i'm on the turn point of my life, so please always cheer us, hope that I can keep on translating on this series until the end of the chapter... it would be couple of years or more to ends saki if Ritz frequently not appearing his issues D:


IATC: Yeah, tomorrow's Friday (At least in the Eastern US), so we'll be safe as long as we get it out in due time. Also, like I said, it's no trouble at all. I actually hit a milestone in my own life just recently, and will hit another one next week. Also, Ritz Kobayashi is a woman. Just pointing that out.


So, anyway, here's this chapter's credit page message:


Right, so after an extended delay, we've managed to put out this chapter. Sorry about that - It's actually been a rather tumulus time in the staff's personal lives ([If it's alright, you can say what's been going on, and I'll paraphrase it], and I(amthecheese), myself, was accepted to Elon University, and will be celebrating my birthday on Christmas Eve (Which is the best birthday ever, by the way.). Regardless, I want to take this opportunity to thank you guys for sticking with us.

Loooooots of development in this chapter. Jindai finally stopped teasing us and showed us her true power, and AWAIAWAIAWAIAWAIAWAIAWAIAWAIAWAI ZOMG IT'S AWA IWAI. The rest of this match will be fun.

If we don't get Chapter 75 out by then, have a very Merry Christmas.
