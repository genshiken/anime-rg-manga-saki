alt: but if it's just simple match with just counting final points without additional modifiers, she's always got plus points

////FIXME FIXME But if the match is simple match that only counts income points and not concerned about OKA and point order (Juniten), she's always got surplus
*TL : OKA(オカ) and juniten(順位点), the keywords to understands suzu's skill, since i don't understand what are they talking about, do something edho ;p

she's even ranked at top last month

that's weird, since she's always the last*~

*er, lowest rank, fix

She won the game by rare chance, but she won explosively

she even got +6000 points as the stronger the opponent become

explosive huh?

Ok then, how about checking her up at next ABmatch
*TL : ABmatch, training match
*or just use training match

fine, as long as the opponent is not our captain
